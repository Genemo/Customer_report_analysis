#By running this program, we can use TPM.txt which is generated by .fastq 
#from each sample, to compare with the cancer-related gene set.

#1. project_path is the folder will save the output files
#2. sample_path is the folder of TPM.txt file for each sample
#3. reference_path is the cancer-related gene sets of 17 types of cancer

#INPUT: TPM.txt from sample
#       *.xml from cancer-related gene set

#OUTPUT: a folder which is names after corresponding sample, save the data we used for calculating.
#        a .txt file which contains the final results of overlapping, .txt have 3 columns of numbers, 
#        1 for # of cancer-related genes, 2 for # of sample genes which meet our threshold value，
#        3 for # of the overlapping genes of 1&2 

#USEAGE: All you need to do is: 1. Setting the paths 
#                               2. Saving data with fixed format into corresponding folders
#                               3. Runing this script
#       （the # of group could change with how many thresholds you want to check, controllsed by 
#         variate TPM_threshould）
#Enjoy!
